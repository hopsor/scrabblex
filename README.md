# Scrabblex

Scrabblex is a clone of the popular board game written in Elixir using Phoenix Framework and LiveView with minimum javascript.

## Requirements

This project persists the data in a Postgresql database. A `compose.yaml` file is included to help you satisfying that dependency.

In addition to that you should load a bunch of env vars listed in the `.envrc.sample` file.

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
